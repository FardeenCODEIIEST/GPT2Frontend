# GPT2 React Frontend

This project serves as the frontend inerface for users for the fine-tuned GPT2 model backend, which can be found [here](https://github.com/FardeenCODEIIEST/GPT2_Fine-Tuned_Model)

It is to be noted that the backend server has not been hosted yet(due to lack of compute resources), but you can always fire up the server locally by referring to the backend repo and click [here](https://presidentgpt2.web.app/) for the frontend experience.
